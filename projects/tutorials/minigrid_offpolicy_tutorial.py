In this tutorial we'll learn how to train an agent from an external dataset by imitating expert actions via
Behavior Cloning. We'll use a [BabyAI agent](/api/plugins/babyai_plugin/babyai_models#BabyAIRecurrentACModel) to solve
`GoToLocal` tasks on [MiniGrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid); see the
`projects/babyai_baselines/experiments/go_to_local` directory for more details.

This tutorial assumes the [installation instructions](../installation/installation-allenact.md) have already been
followed and, to some extent, this framework's [abstractions](../getting_started/abstractions.md) are known.

## The task

In a `GoToLocal` task, the agent immersed in a grid world has to navigate to a specific object in the presence of
multiple distractors, requiring the agent to understand `go to` instructions like "go to the red ball". For further
details, please consult the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08272).

## Getting the dataset

We will use a large dataset (**more than 4 GB**) including expert demonstrations for `GoToLocal` tasks. To download
the data we'll run

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/babyai_plugin/scripts/download_babyai_expert_demos.py GoToLocal
```

from the project's root directory, which will download `BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0.pkl` and `BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0_valid.pkl` to
the `plugins/babyai_plugin/data/demos` directory.

We will also generate small versions of the datasets, which will be useful if running on CPU, by calling

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/babyai_plugin/scripts/truncate_expert_demos.py
```
from the project's root directory, which will generate `BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0-small.pkl` under the same
`plugins/babyai_plugin/data/demos` directory.

## Data iterator

In order to train with an off-policy dataset, we need to define a data `Iterator`.
The `Data Iterator` merges the functionality of the `Dataset` and `Dataloader` in PyTorch,
in that it defines the way to both sample data from the dataset and convert them into batches to be
used for training.
An
example of a `Data Iterator` for BabyAI expert demos might look as follows:
"""

# %% import_summary plugins.minigrid_plugin.minigrid_offpolicy.ExpertTrajectoryIterator

# %%
"""
A complete example can be found in
[ExpertTrajectoryIterator](/api/plugins/minigrid_plugin/minigrid_offpolicy#ExpertTrajectoryIterator).

## Loss function

Off-policy losses must implement the
[AbstractOffPolicyLoss](/api/core/algorithms/offpolicy_sync/losses/abstract_offpolicy_loss/#abstractoffpolicyloss)
interface. In this case, we minimize the cross-entropy between the actor's policy and the expert action:
"""

# %% import plugins.minigrid_plugin.minigrid_offpolicy.MiniGridOffPolicyExpertCELoss

# %%
"""
A complete example can be found in
[MiniGridOffPolicyExpertCELoss](/api/plugins/minigrid_plugin/minigrid_offpolicy#MiniGridOffPolicyExpertCELoss).
Note that in this case we train the entire actor, but it would also be possible to forward data through a different
subgraph of the ActorCriticModel.

## Experiment configuration

For the experiment configuration, we'll build on top of an existing
[base BabyAI GoToLocal Experiment Config](/api/projects/babyai_baselines/experiments/go_to_local/base/#basebabyaigotolocalexperimentconfig).
The complete `ExperimentConfig` file for off-policy training is
[here](/api/projects/tutorials/minigrid_offpolicy_tutorial/#bcoffpolicybabyaigotolocalexperimentconfig), but let's
focus on the most relevant aspect to enable this type of training:
providing an [OffPolicyPipelineComponent](/api/utils/experiment_utils/#offpolicypipelinecomponent) object as input to a
`PipelineStage` when instantiating the `TrainingPipeline` in the `training_pipeline` method.

You'll have noted that it is possible to combine on-policy and off-policy training in the same stage, even though here
we apply pure off-policy training.

## Training

We recommend using a machine with a CUDA-capable GPU for this experiment. In order to start training, we just need to
invoke

```bash
python main.py -b projects/tutorials minigrid_offpolicy_tutorial -m 8 -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

Note that with the `-m 8` option we limit to 8 the number of on-policy task sampling processes used between off-policy
updates.

If everything goes well, the training success should quickly reach values around 0.7-0.8 on GPU and converge to values
close to 1 if given sufficient time to train.

If running tensorboard, you'll notice a separate group of scalars named `offpolicy` with losses, approximate frame rate
and other tracked values in addition to the standard `train` used for on-policy training.

A view of the training progress about 5 minutes after starting on a CUDA-capable GPU should look similar to
