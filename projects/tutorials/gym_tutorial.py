**Note** The provided commands to execute in this tutorial assume you have
[installed the full library](../installation/installation-allenact.md#full-library) and the requirements for the
`gym_plugin`. The latter can be installed by

```bash
pip install -r allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/extra_requirements.txt
```

In this tutorial, we:

1. Introduce the `gym_plugin`, which enables some of the tasks in [OpenAI's gym](https://gym.openai.com/) for training
and inference within AllenAct.
1. Show an example of continuous control with an arbitrary action space covering 2 policies for one of the `gym` tasks.


## The task

For this tutorial, we'll focus on one of the continuous-control environments under the `Box2D` group of `gym`
environments: [LunarLanderContinuous-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLanderContinuous-v2/). In this task, the goal
is to smoothly land a lunar module in a landing pad, as shown below.

![The LunarLanderContinuous-v2 task](../img/lunar_lander_continuous_demo.png).

To achieve this goal, we need to provide continuous control for a main engine and directional one (2 real values). In
order to solve the task, the expected reward is of at least 200 points. The controls for main and directional engines
are both in the range [-1.0, 1.0] and the observation space is composed of 8 scalars indicating `x` and `y` positions,
`x` and `y` velocities, lander angle and angular velocity, and left and right ground contact. Note that these 8 scalars
provide a full observation of the state.


## Implementation

For this tutorial, we'll use the readily available `gym_plugin`, which includes a
[wrapper for `gym` environments](../api/allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/gym_environment.md#gymenvironment), a
[task sampler](../api/allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/gym_tasks.md#gymtasksampler) and
[task definition](../api/allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/gym_tasks.md#gymcontinuousbox2dtask), a
[sensor](../api/allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/gym_sensors.md#gymbox2dsensor) to wrap the observations provided by the `gym`
environment, and a simple [model](../api/allenact_plugins/gym_plugin/gym_models.md#memorylessactorcritic).

The experiment config, similar to the one used for the
[Navigation in MiniGrid tutorial](../tutorials/minigrid-tutorial.md), is defined as follows:

## Training and validation

We have a complete implementation of this experiment's configuration class in `projects/tutorials/gym_tutorial.py`.
To start training from scratch, we just need to invoke

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python allenact/main.py gym_tutorial -b projects/tutorials -m 8 -o /PATH/TO/gym_output -s 54321 -e
```

from the `allenact` root directory. Note that we include `-e` to enforce deterministic evaluation. Please refer to the
[Navigation in MiniGrid tutorial](../tutorials/minigrid-tutorial.md) if in doubt of the meaning of the rest of parameters.

If we have Tensorboard installed, we can track progress with
```bash
tensorboard --logdir /PATH/TO/gym_output
```
which will default to the URL [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).

After 1,200,000 steps, the script will terminate. If everything went well, the `valid` success rate should quickly
converge to 1 and the mean reward to above 250, while the average episode length should stay below or near 300.

## Testing

The training start date for the experiment, in `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` format, is used as the name of one of the
subfolders in the path to the checkpoints, saved under the output folder.
In order to evaluate (i.e. test) a collection of checkpoints, we need to pass the `--eval` flag and specify the 
directory containing the checkpoints with the `--checkpoint CHECKPOINT_DIR` option:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python allenact/main.py gym_tutorial \
    -b projects/tutorials \
    -m 1 \
    -o /PATH/TO/gym_output \
    -s 54321 \
    -e \
    --eval \
    --checkpoint /PATH/TO/gym_output/checkpoints/GymTutorial/YOUR_START_DATE \
    --approx_ckpt_step_interval 800000 # Skip some checkpoints
```

The option `--approx_ckpt_step_interval 800000` tells AllenAct that we only want to evaluate checkpoints
which were saved every ~800000 steps, this lets us avoid evaluating every saved checkpoint. If everything went well, 
the `test` success rate should converge to 1, the episode length below or near 300 steps, and the mean reward to above 
250. The images tab in tensorboard will contain videos for the sampled test episodes.

![video_results](../img/lunar_lander_continuous_test.png).

If the test command fails with `pyglet.canvas.xlib.NoSuchDisplayException: Cannot connect to "None"`, e.g. when running
remotely, try prepending `DISPLAY=:0.0` to the command above, assuming you have an xserver running with such display
available:

```bash
DISPLAY=:0.0 PYTHONPATH=. python allenact/main.py gym_tutorial \
    -b projects/tutorials \
    -m 1 \
    -o /PATH/TO/gym_output \
    -s 54321 \
    -e \  
    --eval \
    --checkpoint /PATH/TO/gym_output/checkpoints/GymTutorial/YOUR_START_DATE \
    --approx_ckpt_step_interval 800000 
```
