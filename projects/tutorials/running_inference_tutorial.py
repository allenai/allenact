"""# Tutorial: Inference with a pre-trained model."""

"""
In this tutorial we will run inference on a pre-trained model for the PointNav task
in the RoboTHOR environment. In this task the agent is tasked with going to a specific location
within a realistic 3D environment.

For information on how to train a PointNav Model see [this tutorial](training-a-pointnav-model.md)

We will need to [install the RoboTHOR environment](../installation/installation-allenact.md) and [download the 
RoboTHOR Pointnav dataset](../installation/download-datasets.md) before we get started.

For this tutorial we will download the weights of a model trained on the debug dataset.
This can be done with a handy script in the `pretrained_model_ckpts` directory:
```bash
bash pretrained_model_ckpts/download_navigation_model_ckpts.sh robothor-pointnav-rgb-resnet
```
This will download the weights for an RGB model that has been
trained on the PointNav task in RoboTHOR to `pretrained_model_ckpts/robothor-pointnav-rgb-resnet`


Next we need to run the inference, using the PointNav experiment config from the
[tutorial on making a PointNav experiment](training-a-pointnav-model.md).
We can do this with the following command:

```bash
python main.py -o <PATH_TO_OUTPUT> -c <PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT> -b <BASE_DIRECTORY_OF_YOUR_EXPERIMENT> -t <TIMESTAMP>
```

Where `<PATH_TO_OUTPUT>` is the location where the results of the test will be dumped, `<PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT>` is the 
location of the downloaded model weights, `<BASE_DIRECTORY_OF_YOUR_EXPERIMENT>` is a path to the directory where 
our experiment definition is stored, and `<TIMESTAMP>` is the unique timestamp associated with when the model was
trained.
 
For our current setup the following command would work:

```bash
python main.py \
    training_a_pointnav_model \
    -o pretrained_model_ckpts/robothor-pointnav-rgb-resnet/ \
    -c pretrained_model_ckpts/robothor-pointnav-rgb-resnet/checkpoints/PointNavRobothorRGBPPO/2020-08-31_12-13-30/exp_PointNavRobothorRGBPPO__stage_00__steps_000039031200.pt \
    -b projects/tutorials \
    -t 2020-08-31_12-13-30
```

For testing on all saved checkpoints we just need to omit `<PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT>`:

```bash
python main.py \
    training_a_pointnav_model \
    -o pretrained_model_ckpts/robothor-pointnav-rgb-resnet/ \
    -b projects/tutorials  \
    -t 2020-08-31_12-13-30
```
## Visualization

We also show examples of visualizations that can be extracted from the `"valid"` and `"test"` modes. Currently,
visualization is still undergoing design changes and does not support multi-agent tasks, but the available functionality
is sufficient for pointnav in RoboThor.

Following up on the example above, we can make a specialized pontnav `ExperimentConfig` where we instantiate
the base visualization class, `VizSuite`, defined in
[`utils.viz_utils`](https://github.com/allenai/allenact/tree/master/utils/viz_utils.py), when in `test` mode.

Each visualization type can be thought of as a plugin to the base `VizSuite`. For example, all `episode_ids` passed to
`VizSuite` will be processed with each of the instantiated visualization types (possibly with the exception of the
`AgentViewViz`). In the example below we show how to instantiate different visualization types from 4 different data
sources.

The data sources available to `VizSuite` are:

* Task output (e.g. 2D trajectories)
* Vector task (e.g. egocentric views)
* Rollout storage (e.g. recurrent memory, taken action logprobs...)
* `ActorCriticOutput` (e.g. action probabilities)

The visualization types included below are:

* `TrajectoryViz`: Generic 2D trajectory view.
* `AgentViewViz`: RGB egocentric view.
* `ActorViz`: Action probabilities from `ActorCriticOutput[CategoricalDistr]`.
* `TensorViz1D`: Evolution of a point from RolloutStorage over time.
* `TensorViz2D`: Evolution of a vector from RolloutStorage over time.
* `ThorViz`: Specialized 2D trajectory view
[for RoboThor](https://github.com/allenai/allenact/tree/master/plugins/robothor_plugin/robothor_viz.py).

Note that we need to explicitly set the `episode_ids` that we wish to visualize. For `AgentViewViz` we have the option
of using a different (typically shorter) list of episodes or enforce the ones used for the rest of visualizations.
