# Downloading datasets 

The below provides instructions on how to download datasets necessary for defining the train, validation, and
test sets used within the ObjectNav/PointNav tasks in the `iTHOR`, `RoboTHOR`, and `habitat` environments.

<!--
Note that these datasets **do not include** scene assets for the below datasets. For `iTHOR` and `RoboTHOR`
these scene assets will be downloaded automatically, for `habitat` please following the instructions
in [this tutorial](installation-framework.md).
-->

## Point Navigation (PointNav)

### RoboTHOR
To get the PointNav dataset and precomputed distance caches for `RoboTHOR` run the following command:
```bash
bash datasets/download_navigation_datasets.sh robothor-pointnav
```
This will download the dataset into `datasets/robothor-pointnav`.
### iTHOR
To get the PointNav dataset and precomputed distance caches for `iTHOR` run the following command:
```bash
bash datasets/download_navigation_datasets.sh ithor-pointnav
```
This will download the dataset into `datasets/ithor-pointnav`.

### Habitat
To get the PointNav `habitat` dataset download and install the `allenact-habitat` docker
container as described in [this tutorial](installation-framework.md). The dataset is
included in the docker image.

## Object Navigation (ObjectNav)

### RoboTHOR
To get the ObjectNav dataset and precomputed distance caches for `RoboTHOR` run the following command:

```bash
bash datasets/download_navigation_datasets.sh robothor-objectnav
```
This will download the dataset into `datasets/robothor-objectnav`.

### iTHOR
To get the ObjectNav dataset and precomputed distance caches for `iTHOR` run the following command:
```bash
bash datasets/download_navigation_datasets.sh robothor-pointnav
```
This will download the dataset into `datasets/ithor-objectnav`.
