# Tutorial: Navigation in MiniGrid
 
In this tutorial, we will train an agent to complete the `MiniGrid-Empty-Random-5x5-v0` task within the [MiniGrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) environment. We will demonstrate how to:

* Write an experiment configuration file with a simple training pipeline from scratch.
* Use one of the supported environments with minimal user effort.
* Train, validate and test your experiment from the command line.

This tutorial assumes the [installation instructions](../getting_started/installation.md) have already been followed and, to some
extent, this framework's [abstractions](../getting_started/abstractions.md) are known.

## The task
A `MiniGrid-Empty-Random-5x5-v0` task consists of a grid of dimensions 5x5 where an agent spawned at a random
location and orientation has to navigate to the visitable bottom right corner cell of the grid by sequences of three
possible actions (rotate left/right and move forward). A visualization of the environment with expert steps in a random
`MiniGrid-Empty-Random-5x5-v0` task looks like

![MiniGridEmptyRandom5x5 task example](../img/minigrid_environment.png)

The observation for the agent is a subset of the entire grid, simulating a simplified limited field of view, as
depicted by the highlighted rectangle (observed subset of the grid) around the agent (red arrow). Gray cells correspond
to walls.

## Experiment configuration file

Our complete experiment consists of:

* Training a basic actor-critic agent with memory to solve randomly sampled navigation tasks.
* Validation on a fixed set of tasks (running in parallel with training).
* A second stage where we test saved checkpoints with a larger fixed set of tasks.

The entire configuration for the experiment, including training, validation, and testing, is encapsulated in a single 
class implementing the `ExperimentConfig` abstraction. For this tutorial, we will follow the config under
`projects/tutorials/minigrid_tutorial.py`. 

The `ExperimentConfig` abstraction is used by the
[OnPolicyTrainer](../api/core/algorithms/onpolicy_sync/light_engine.md#onpolicytrainer) class (for training) and the
[OnPolicyInference](../api/core/algorithms/onpolicy_sync/light_engine.md#onpolicyinference) class (for validation and testing)
invoked through the entry script `ddmain.py` that calls an orchestrating
[OnPolicyRunner](../api/core/algorithms/onpolicy_sync/runner.md#onpolicyrunner) class. It includes:

* A `tag` method to identify the experiment.
* A `create_model` method to instantiate actor-critic models.
* A `make_sampler_fn` method to instantiate task samplers.
* Three `{train,valid,test}_task_sampler_args` methods describing initialization parameters for task samplers used in
training, validation, and testing; including assignment of workers to devices for simulation.
* A `machine_params` method with configuration parameters that will be used for training, validation, and testing.
* A `training_pipeline` method describing a possibly multi-staged training pipeline with different types of losses,
an optimizer, and other parameters like learning rates, batch sizes, etc.

### Preliminaries

We first identify the experiment through a `tag`.  

```python
class MiniGridTutorialExperimentConfig(ExperimentConfig):
    @classmethod
    def tag(cls) -> str:
        return "MiniGridTutorial"
```

### Sensors and Model

A readily available Sensor type for MiniGrid,
[EgocentricMiniGridSensor](../api/plugins/minigrid_plugin/minigrid_sensors.md#egocentricminigridsensor),
allows us to extract observations in a format consumable by an `ActorCriticModel` agent:

```python
    SENSORS = [
        EgocentricMiniGridSensor(agent_view_size=5, view_channels=3),
    ]
```

The three `view_channels` include objects, colors and states corresponding to a partial observation of the environment
as an image tensor, equivalent to that from `ImgObsWrapper` in https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid#wrappers. The
relatively large `agent_view_size` means the view will only be clipped by the environment walls in the forward and
lateral directions with respect to the agent's orientation.

We define our `ActorCriticModel` agent using a lightweight implementation with recurrent memory for MiniGrid
environments, [MiniGridSimpleConvRNN](../api/plugins/minigrid_plugin/minigrid_models.md#minigridsimpleconvrnn):

```python
    @classmethod
    def create_model(cls, **kwargs) -> nn.Module:
        return MiniGridSimpleConvRNN(
            action_space=gym.spaces.Discrete(len(MiniGridTask.class_action_names())),
            observation_space=SensorSuite(cls.SENSORS).observation_spaces,
            num_objects=cls.SENSORS[0].num_objects,
            num_colors=cls.SENSORS[0].num_colors,
            num_states=cls.SENSORS[0].num_states,
        )
```

### Task samplers

We use an available TaskSampler implementation for MiniGrid environments that allows to sample both random and
deterministic `MiniGridTasks`,
[MiniGridTaskSampler](../api/plugins/minigrid_plugin/minigrid_tasks.md#minigridtasksampler):

```python
    @classmethod
    def make_sampler_fn(cls, **kwargs) -> TaskSampler:
        return MiniGridTaskSampler(**kwargs)
```

This task sampler will during training (or validation/testing), randomly initialize new tasks for the agent to complete.
While it is not quite as important for this task type (as we test our agent in the same setting it is trained on) there
are a lot of good reasons we would like to sample tasks differently during training than during validation or testing.
One good reason, that is applicable in this tutorial, is that, during training, we would like to be able to sample tasks
forever while, during testing, we would like to sample a fixed number of tasks (as otherwise we would never finish
testing!). In `allenact` this is made possible by defining different arguments for the task sampler:

```python
    def train_task_sampler_args(
        self,
        process_ind: int,
        total_processes: int,
        devices: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        seeds: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        deterministic_cudnn: bool = False,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return self._get_sampler_args(process_ind=process_ind, mode="train")

    def valid_task_sampler_args(
        self,
        process_ind: int,
        total_processes: int,
        devices: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        seeds: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        deterministic_cudnn: bool = False,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return self._get_sampler_args(process_ind=process_ind, mode="valid")

    def test_task_sampler_args(
        self,
        process_ind: int,
        total_processes: int,
        devices: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        seeds: Optional[List[int]] = None,
        deterministic_cudnn: bool = False,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return self._get_sampler_args(process_ind=process_ind, mode="test")
```

where, for convenience, we have defined a `_get_sampler_args` method:

```python
    def _get_sampler_args(self, process_ind: int, mode: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Generate initialization arguments for train, valid, and test TaskSamplers.

        # Parameters
        process_ind : index of the current task sampler
        mode:  one of `train`, `valid`, or `test`
        """
        if mode == "train":
            max_tasks = None                # infinite training tasks
            task_seeds_list = None          # no predefined random seeds for training
            deterministic_sampling = False  # randomly sample tasks in training
        else:
            max_tasks = 20 + 20 * (mode == "test")  # 20 tasks for valid, 40 for test

            # one seed for each task to sample:
            # - ensures different seeds for each sampler, and
            # - ensures a deterministic set of sampled tasks.
            task_seeds_list = list(range(process_ind * max_tasks, (process_ind + 1) * max_tasks))

            deterministic_sampling = True  # deterministically sample task in validation/testing

        return dict(
            max_tasks=max_tasks,                           # see above
            env_class=self.make_env,                       # builder for third-party environment (defined below)
            sensors=self.SENSORS,                          # sensors used to return observations to the agent
            env_info=dict(),                               # parameters for environment builder (none for now)
            task_seeds_list=task_seeds_list,               # see above
            deterministic_sampling=deterministic_sampling  # see above
        )
    
    @staticmethod
    def make_env(*args, **kwargs):
        return EmptyRandomEnv5x5()
```

Note that the `env_class` argument to the Task Sampler is the one determining which task type we are going to train the
model for (in this case, `MiniGrid-Empty-Random-5x5-v0` from
[gym-minigrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid#empty-environment))
. The sparse reward is
[given by the environment](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid/blob/6e22a44dc67414b647063692258a4f95ce789161/gym_minigrid/minigrid.py#L819)
, and the maximum task length is 100. For training, we opt for a default random sampling, whereas for validation and
test we define fixed sets of randomly sampled tasks without needing to explicitly define a dataset.

In this toy example, the maximum number of different tasks is 32. For validation we sample 320 tasks using 16 samplers,
or 640 for testing, so we can be fairly sure that all possible tasks are visited at least once during evaluation.

### Machine parameters

Given the simplicity of the task and model, we can quickly train the model on the CPU:

```python
    @classmethod
    def machine_params(cls, mode="train", **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "nprocesses": 128 if mode == "train" else 16,
            "gpu_ids": [],
        }
```

We allocate a larger number of samplers for training (128) than for validation or testing (16), and we default to CPU
usage by returning an empty list of `gpu_ids`.

### Training pipeline

The last definition required before starting to train is a training pipeline. In this case, we just use a single PPO
stage with linearly decaying learning rate:

```python
    @classmethod
    def training_pipeline(cls, **kwargs) -> TrainingPipeline:
        ppo_steps = int(150000)
        return TrainingPipeline(
            named_losses=dict(ppo_loss=Builder(PPO, kwargs={}, default=PPOConfig,)),
            pipeline_stages=[
                PipelineStage(loss_names=["ppo_loss"], max_stage_steps=ppo_steps)
            ],
            optimizer_builder=Builder(optim.Adam, dict(lr=1e-4)),
            num_mini_batch=4,
            update_repeats=3,
            max_grad_norm=0.5,
            num_steps=16,
            gamma=0.99,
            use_gae=True,
            gae_lambda=0.95,
            advance_scene_rollout_period=None,
            save_interval=10000,
            metric_accumulate_interval=1,
            lr_scheduler_builder=Builder(
                LambdaLR, {"lr_lambda": LinearDecay(steps=ppo_steps)}
            ),
        )
```

You can see that we use a `Builder` class to postpone the construction of some of the elements, like the optimizer,
for which the model weights need to be known.

## Training and validation

We have a complete implementation of this experiment's configuration class in `projects/tutorials/minigrid_tutorial.py`.
To start training from scratch, we just need to invoke

```bash
python ddmain.py minigrid_tutorial -b projects/tutorials -m 8 -o /PATH/TO/minigrid_output -s 12345
```

from the project root folder.

* With `-b projects/tutorials` we set the base folder to search for the `minigrid_tutorial` experiment configuration.
* With `-m 8` we limit the number of subprocesses to 8 (each subprocess will run 16 of the 128 training task samplers).
* With `-o /PATH/TO/minigrid_output` we set the output folder.
* With `-s 12345` we set the random seed.

If we have Tensorboard installed, we can track progress with
```bash
tensorboard --logdir /PATH/TO/minigrid_output
```
which will default to the URL [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).

After 150,000 steps, the script will terminate and several checkpoints will be saved in the output folder.
The training curves should look similar to:

![training curves](../img/minigrid_train.png)

If everything went well, the `valid` success rate should converge to 1 and the mean episode length to a value below 4.
(For perfectly uniform sampling and complete observation, the expectation for the optimal policy is 3.75 steps.) In the
not-so-unlikely event of the run failing to converge to a near-optimal policy, we can just try to re-run (for example
with a different random seed). The validation curves should look similar to:

![validation curves](../img/minigrid_valid.png)

## Testing

The training start date for the experiment, in `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` format, is used as the name of one of the
subfolders in the path to the checkpoints, saved under the output folder.
In order to test for a specific experiment, we need to pass its training start date with the option
`-t EXPERIMENT_DATE`:

```bash
python ddmain.py minigrid_tutorial -b projects/tutorials -m 1 -o /PATH/TO/minigrid_output -s 12345 -t EXPERIMENT_DATE
```

Again, if everything went well, the `test` success rate should converge to 1 and the mean episode length to a value
below 4. Detailed results are saved under a `metrics` subfolder in the output folder.
The test curves should look similar to:

![test curves](../img/minigrid_test.png)
