# EmbodiedRL

EmbodiedRL is a library designed for research in embodied reinforcement learning with
a focus on modularity, flexibility, and low cognitive overhead. This work builds upon
the [pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail) 
library of Ilya Kostrikov and uses some data structures from FAIR's 
[habitat-api](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-api).

## Why `embodied-rl`?

There are an increasingly 
[large collection](https://winderresearch.com/a-comparison-of-reinforcement-learning-frameworks-dopamine-rllib-keras-rl-coach-trfl-tensorforce-coach-and-more/) 
of deep reinforcement learning packages and so it is natural to question why we introduce another framework
reproducing many of the same algorithms and ideas. After performing of survey of existing frameworks we
could not find a package delivering all of the following features, each of which we considered critical.

1. *Decoupled tasks and environments*: In embodied AI research it is important to be 
   able to define many tasks for a single environment; for instance, the [AI2-THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org/)
   environment has been used with tasks such as  
   
    * [semantic/object navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06543),
    * [interactive question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03316),
    * [multi-agent furniture lifting](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/two-body-problem), and
    * [adversarial hide-and-seek](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08195).
   
    We have designed `embodied-rl` to easily support a wide variety of tasks designed for individual environments.

1. *First-class pytorch support*: While many well-developed libraries exist for reinforcement learning in 
   tensorflow, we are one of a few to target pytorch.
1. *Configuration as code*: In `embodied-rl` experiments are 
   defined using python classes, so knowing how to extend an abstract python class we can define an
   experiment.
1. *Type checking and documentation*: We have put significant effort into providing extensive documentation and type
   annotations throughout our codebase.


## Installation

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine and moving into the top-level directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:allenai/embodied-rl.git
cd embodied-rl
```

This library has been tested **only in python 3.6**, the following assumes you have a working
version of **python 3.6** installed locally. In order to install requirements we recommend
using [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) but also include instructions if
you would prefer to install things directly using `pip`.

### Installing requirements with `pipenv` (*recommended*)

If you have already installed [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/), you may
run the following to install all requirements.

```bash
pipenv install --skip-lock --dev
```

### Installing requirements with `pip`

Note: *do not* run the following if you have already installed requirements with `pipenv`
as above. If you prefer using `pip`, you may install all requirements as follows

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Depending on your machine configuration, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in the
above.

### Run your first experiment

You are now ready to [run your first experiment](./overview/running-your-first-experiment.md).

## Contributions

We in the Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research (PRIOR) group at the
 Allen Institute for AI (AI2, @allenai) welcome contributions from the greater community. If
 you would like to make such a contributions we recommend first submitting an 
 [issue](https://github.com/allenai/embodied-rl/issues) describing your proposed improvement.
 Doing so can ensure we can validate your suggestions before you spend a great deal of time
 upon them. Small (or validated) improvements and bug fixes should be made via a pull request
 from your fork of this repository.
 
All code in this repository is subject to formatting, documentation, and type-annotation
guidelines. For more details, please see the our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
